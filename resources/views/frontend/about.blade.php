                <p>“Having gotten countless calls and requests from women who desire to be mentored and even mentored a few personally along the lines of ministry, God laid it on my heart to put together a platform where women who desire to be effective in ministry, women who have questions in their heart concerning ministry and balancing it with the home front can get answers to those questions”, says Pastor Funke Obadje.</p>
                <p>Hence, the REFINED course and mentoring program. This three-month intensive online course is a catalyst to jump-start and refine you into a thoroughly furnished minister, effective in this day.</p>
                <p>This platform will expose you to powerful teachings, thought-provoking seminars and assignments that will help you unearth the treasures that lie within you and build capacity for your assignment.</p>
                <p>During this course,you will be required to attend all teachings which would be made available in audio and video format online, at the end of which there will be a take home assignment to be submitted at the end of the week. All these would be done online.During this course, you will be required to attend all teachings which would be made available in audio and video format online, at the end of which there will be a take-home assignment to be submitted at the end of each week. Note, all these would be done online.</p>
                <p>So, are you a woman with a call upon her life? <br>
                    Are you a woman in ministry? <br>
                    Do you desire to be an effective minister? <br>
                    Then, this platform is for you!</p>
                <p>It is worthy of note to emphasise that on a weekly basis, you would be attending live teaching sessions with Pastor Funke and by the grace of God, it will be an empowering and destiny encountering prophetic moment where you will be prayed for and imparted for the assignment ahead.</p>
